This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Flash
  This project's main goal is to create a decentralised financial (DeFi) application. It entails leveraging flash loans to purchase assets and then arbitraging those assets on the Decentralised Exchange (DEX) platform. It also would help users to find platforms with cheap purchasing prices and high selling prices to benefit from the price difference. The project is built using Hardhat to write, test, and deploy smart contracts. It also contains the design of a frontend interface and deployment on Vercel which is an online web hosting service. The project primarily finishes connecting popular DeFi platforms such as Aave, Uniswap, and Sushiswap to enable flash loans, arbitrage, liquidity supply for earning interest and so on. The project considers the security of smart contracts and analyses the gas usage efficiency of key functions. The benefit of flash loans is the ability to receive money without requiring collateral, allowing customers to generate profits at no expense. It is crucial to identify arbitrage opportunities quickly and accurately to succeed in real since market prices fluctuate and arbitrage attempts may fail. The importance of this project stems from its potential to help users identify and implement arbitrage opportunities.
